=== A process of emergence

In keeping with the entrepreneurial spirit that gave rise to the Agile movement and works like Ries' http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898/[_The Lean Startup_,] I am structuring this book around a progressive, evolutionary approach. Your journey through it reflects a process of emergence. Such processes are most often associated with founding and scaling a startup. There are many helpful books on this topic, such as:

* http://www.amazon.com/Nail-then-Scale-Entrepreneurs-Breakthrough/dp/0983723605[_Nail it then scale it_] by Furr and Ahlstrom
* http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Up-Companies-Rockefeller-Habits-ebook/dp/B00O5RR7QO/[_Scaling Up_] by Harnish
* http://www.amazon.com/Startup-CEO-Scaling-Business-Website/dp/1118548361[_Startup CEO_] by Blumberg
* http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_y[_The Lean Startup_] by Ries

However, this is not a textbook (or course) on a full startup process. It remains IT-centric. *And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.* In fact, it prepares students for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:

* Individual
* Team
* Small company
* Enterprise

Whether students are in a startup, or on a journey within a larger, established organization, they will (hopefully) become aware as they progress through a broadening context:

* Other team members
* Customers
* Suppliers
* Sponsors
* Necessary non-IT capabilities (finance, legal, HR, sales, marketing, etc)
* Channel partners
* Auditors and regulators

Part of maturing in one's career is understanding how all these relationships figure into your own overall system of value delivery. This will be a lifelong journey for you; my intent is to give you some useful tools.

=== This book's structure

Here is a conceptual illustration of an IT management progression:

As a structuring mechanism, I have tested this in the classroom with some success. I divide a 14-week semester into four major sections, with each having a distinct "persona" for the students to adopt:

.... *Inception*: The students are teamed as pairs of practitioners , each in a hypothetical startup, in a garage.

.... *Collaboration*: The students are in teams of 6-9, enough for specialization to emerge, but still intensely collaborative. A startup that has started to become viable.

.... *Coordination*: The entire class becomes one large organization, a "team of teams" faced with the hard problems of coordination and communication across space and time barriers.

.... *Maturation*: Students are in groups of 4-5, representing the executive leadership of a large enterprise, concerned with IT portfolios, analytics, and the complex dynamics of running heterogeneous IT at massive scale.

Elaborating the above outline into chapters, we have:

..... *Inception*

. _IT value_. Why do we need computers? What can they do for us?
. _IT infrastructure_ We want to build something. We have to choose a platform first.
. _IT applications_ Let's start building something of use to someone.

..... *Collaboration*
[start=4]
. _Product management_ What exactly is it we are building? How do we better define it for a bigger team?
. _Work management_ How do we keep track and communicate at the most basic level?
. _Operations management_ How do we sustain this surprisingly fragile computing-based service, in its ongoing delivery of IT value?

..... *Coordination*
[start=7]
. _Culture and organization_ We're getting big. How do we deal with this? How are we structured? Why this way and not that?
. _Project and resource management_ Work is becoming larger and more complex. We need the ability to track and execute larger segments of it.
. _Process management_ We have a structure. Work needs to flow across it.

..... *Maturation*
[start=10]
. _Security, and Governance, Risk, and Compliance_ We need to cope with external forces (regulators, vendor partners, security adversaries, auditors) increasingly defining our options.

. _Enterprise Information Management_ We've been concerned with data, information, and knowledge since the earliest days of our journey. But at this scale, we have to formalize our approaches and understandings; without that, we will never capture the full value available with modern analytics and Big Data.

. _Architecture and Portfolio_ We need to understand the big picture of interacting lifecycles, reduce technical debt and redundancy, and obtain better economies of scale. We need to define our investment strategy based on a sound understanding of both business needs and technology limitations.


..... *Appendices*
. _A review of IT frameworks and standards_
. _Architectural depictions_
. _Towards a theory of IT management_

The central advantage of this approach is that it is ideal for the new student. There are no technical prerequisites for a course based on this text, although it can be a lot of work for those completely new to IT. Discussions of advanced IT issues such as process frameworks are presented as part of a logical evolutionary progression and thought experiment, rather than simply dropped on the unsuspecting student.

_Instructor's note_

I have spent considerable time thinking (agonizing) about the correct ordering of the chapters within these sections. This is possibly the tenth or twelfth version of the chapter ordering. This is an area where I want critical review, but also have strong opinions.

There is benefit to restricting the chapters to 12, as a typical semester runs 14 weeks and the book then fits quite nicely, with one chapter per class and allowing for an introductory session and final exam. (Trying to modfiy the semester system is out of scope for this project.) Of course, a two-semester series, with 2 weeks per chapter, would also work well; each half of the book is also a logical unit.

The governing thought experiment is, "what would I turn my attention to next as my IT-based concerns scale up?" For example, I think work management (implying rudimentary workflow) correctly comes before formalized project management, and project management comes before fully formalized process management (including frameworks such as CMMI, COBIT and ITIL).

Note that this would be a testable and falsifiable theory, if empirical research were done to inventory and characterize organization scaling patterns. If we found (for example) that a majority of organizations adopt ITIL or CMM before formalizing project management, that would indicate that chapters 8 and 9 should be flipped.

Also, you may notice that *the chapter titles don't necessarily reflect "Agile" terminology*. This is also deliberate, as students are going into a diverse world of much long-established IT. Furthermore, putting "Agile" as a qualifier on each chapter seems gratuitous (e.g. "Agile Operations Management" instead of just "Operations Management.")

The first word of the book's title is "Agile." That declares the orientation, and the proof will be in the reading. My intent is to involve experienced Agile practitioners in contributing to the sections most relevant to them, and I anticipate a high quality end result that is recognizably supportive of the Agile movement's goals and ambitions.

The book however is not a complete dismissal of older models of IT delivery. Wherever possible, Agile is presented as an evolutionary step relative to what has gone before. The specifics of "what's different" are identified, in the interest of de-mystifying what can be a fraught and quasi-religious topic. In the words of Don Reinertsen, you can have "faith based Agile or science based Agile." This book is strictly interested in the latter. Pointers to relevant theory are included, although this is NOT a theoretical text. That will come later...footnote:[Effective pedagogy requires theory. I seek assistance in both the emerging theory of IT, and relevant theories of pedagogy. I am an amateur in both.]

*This emergence model can also be understood as an individual's progression within a larger enterprise.* Even if one starts from Day 1 at a Fortune 100 corporation, I believe the progression of one's understanding still progresses through individual, to team, to "team of teams," to enterprise. Of course, one may cease evolving one's understanding at any of these stages, with corresponding implications for one's career.

Some of you may be familiar with the idea of a Minimum Viable Product, Minimum Marketable Release, or similar. In these terms, it is important to understand that each *section* of the book represents an MVP, but not each chapter. One can't begin to deliver IT value without the components discussed in each of Chapters 1-3. The chapters of each section are interdependent, in other words.

More structure w/in structure: Each chapter flows in a roughly "top-down" fashion:

. "Business" concerns (value, motivation)
. "Process" concerns (execution, flow)
. "System" concerns (information & automation)
