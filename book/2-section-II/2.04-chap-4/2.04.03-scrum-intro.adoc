==== Introducing Scrum


One way that the product owner maximizes ROI is by directing the team toward the most valuable work, and away from less valuable work. That is, the product owner controls the order, sometimes called priority, of items in the teamâ€™s backlog. In scrum, no-one but the product owner is authorized to ask the team to do work or to change the order of backlog items.
