==== The service desk

The Service Desk (aka Help Desk), is the human face of IT when the IT systems are not meeting people's expectations. We were first briefly introduced to the concept in our Service Lifecycle:

The service desk is an interrupt-driven, task-oriented capability. It serves as a first point of contact for IT services that require some human support or intervention. As such its role can become broad, from provisioning access to assisting users in navigation & usage, to serving as an alert channel for outage reporting.

The service desk ideally answers each user's request immediately, requiring no followup. If followup is required, a "ticket" is "issued."

The term "ticket" dates to paper-based industrial processes, where the "help desk" might actually be a physical desk, where a user seeking services might be issued a paper ticket. Such "tickets" were also used in field services:

In IT-centric domains, tickets are virtual; they are records in databases, not paper. The user is given a ticket "ID" or "number" for tracking (e.g., so they can inquire about the request's status.) The ticket may be "routed" to someone to handle, but again in a virtual world what really happens is that the person it's routed to is directed to look at the record in the database. (In paper based processes, the ticket might well be moved physically to various parties to perform the needed work.)
