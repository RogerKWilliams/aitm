Project management is a deep and wide field, at its most mature showing the influence of operations theory and research. This section is intended to give you a brief overview of its foundational elements and reach. For a more in depth treatment, see <<PMI2013>> and <<Richardson2010>>. For Agile,  Lean, and Theory of Constraints aspects, see <<Cobb2015>>, <<Goldratt1997>>, and (once again) <<Reinertsen2009>> (especially the discussion of Weighted Shortest Job First).
