==== IT sourcing
*IT sourcing* is the set of concerns related to identifying suppliers (sources) of the necessary inputs to deliver digital value.

The basic classes of inputs include:

* People (with certain skills and knowledge)
* Hardware
* Software
* Services (which themselves are composed of people, hardware, and/or software)

Practically speaking, these inputs are handled by two different functions:

* People (in particular, full time employees) are handled by a Human Resources function.
* Hardware, software, and services are handled by a Procurement function. Other terms associated with this are Vendor Management, Contract Management, and Supplier Management. We will not attempt to clarify or rationalize these areas in this section.

We will defer the question of people and their skills and knowledge to the next section.
