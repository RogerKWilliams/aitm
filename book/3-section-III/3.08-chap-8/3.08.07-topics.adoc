===== Notes

Project v program: Program: This term can describe two different situations. First, a program can be a set of goals that gives rise to specific projects, but, unlike a project, a program can never be completely accomplished. For example, a health-awareness program can never completely achieve its goal (the public will never be totally aware of all health issues as a result of a health-awareness program), but one or more projects may accomplish specific results related to the programâ€™s goal (such as a workshop on minimizing the risk of heart disease). Second, a program sometimes refers to a group of specified projects that achieve a common goal.

EVM could be described as a "model" used for understanding the
execution of software projects. It includes mathematical formulae
which are intended to provide insights into project dynamics. However
as will be discussed, the model does not take into consideration
feedback. It is an Open-Loop system model. Kennaley p44
