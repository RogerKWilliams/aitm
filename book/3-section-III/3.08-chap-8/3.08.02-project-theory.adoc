==== Principles and theories of project management

The previous chapter discussed some typical applications of project management, starting with very simple examples and moving into more complex topics.

However, project management (NOT restricted to IT) is a defined area of study, theory, and professional practice. This section provides a (necessarily brief) overview of these topics.

We will discuss the Project Management Body of Knowledge, which is the leading industry framework in project management, at least in the United States. (PRINCE2 is another framework, originating from the UK, which will not be covered in this edition.)

We will also discuss the author's own framework for understanding project demand holistically in the context of other forms of demand. We will compare project execution to more general problems of scheduling and execution, and finally we will take a brief look at Eli Goldratt's Critical Chain.

===== The Project Management Body of Knowledge
The second half of this book will devote increasing attention to frameworks. What is a framework?
A framework is a formalized body of knowledge, usually sustained by some appropriate professional body, that defines the necessary and appropriate skills and concepts for practitioners.

The Project Management Body of Knowledge is sustained by the Project Management Institute,

_the world's leading not-for-profit professional membership association for the project, program and portfolio management profession. Founded in 1969, PMI delivers value for more than 2.9 million professionals working in nearly every country in the world through global advocacy, collaboration, education and research. PMI advances careers, improves organizational success and further matures the profession of project management through its globally recognized standards, certifications, resources, tools, academic research, publications, professional development courses, and networking opportunities_ (from http://www.pmi.org/About-Us.aspx[www.pmi.org]).

The Project Management Body of Knowledge is articulated in a publication, _A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowlege._ While this may seem to imply that the PMBOK and its guide are two different things, they are not -- it is one publication.



===== The two dimensions of demand management


===== Scheduling and execution

Turning to the problem of transactional friction:

This problem is distinct from the problem of feedback. It is also a bit more obvious on a tactical level. The most common response is project management.

To understand how project management works across a functionally organized system, consider the internals of each functional area:

Each combination of worker and equipment can be considered a workstation in this simplified model.

If there is concern for flow across the functional areas, one technique used in manufacturing is that of expediting. The expeditor tracks the process across the work stations and ensures that any friction or blockages are overcome so that the entire process completes and value is delivered. This can be seen as a preliminary form of project management.

As the production line evolves, scheduling may be used as well: the assignment of work to each workstation (combination of worker and equipment) may have its timing and duration specified in advance. While this is not an optimal approach according to Lean philosophy (which emphasizes "pull" techniques), production scheduling is widely used in manufacturing.

NOTE: Production scheduling is a large topic in and of itself. It is part of the domain of interest of the professional organization, The American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS).

IT systems development, when crossing functions, is rarely if ever considered as a simple end to end process that can run itself, with only a lightweight expeditor. Instead, since there is substantially increased complexity, a project paradigm is used across the functions. The project manager plays the role of expanded expeditor:

The above diagram, which you should study carefully, is a more detailed representation of the classic "waterfall" project. It still bears strong similarities to the idealized manufacturing model presented just previously. In particular, notice that the default model is that *the need for the resource is tightly bounded by the calendar*. In the above model, the following resource requirements are apparent:

. One Requirements analyst is needed between times A and B (e.g, from May 1 through 15).
. One Architect is needed between times B and C (e.g., from May 16 through 31)
. One Developer is needed between times C and D (e.g., from June 1 through 15)
. One Release Engineer is needed between times D and E (e.g., from June 15 through 30)

*This is a deliberately unworkable model for illustration.* (But the author can attest it has been tried...) Sometimes, the terms "mechanistic," "deterministic," or "linear" are used to describe waterfall project methods. This shows them at their extreme, insofar as they are essentially translations of a manufacturing model.

The basic problem: if the Developer is released from the project on June 15, and issues were to arise on June 20 with the release, flow would be interrupted and the system would not be delivered successfully.

Because of this, the project may retain some residual claim on all the engaged resources, but their utilization may be low or zero at certain points. Pivoting the above diagram 90 degrees, we start to develop an understanding of the interrelatedness of product development:

NOTE: The above diagram resembles the Rational Unified Process <<link>>. This is deliberate. RUP is notable as an early and widely publicized illustration of these matters.

The project manager is expected to manage the uncertain handoffs between the various functional areas, and anticipate resource requirements stemming from unexpected feedback demands.
