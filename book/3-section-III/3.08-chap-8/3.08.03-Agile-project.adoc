==== Agile and project management
[quote, Stanley Portny, Project Management for Dummies 4th ed.]
Projects of all types and sizes are now *the* way that organizations accomplish their work [emphasis added].

[quote, Sriram Narayan, "Scaling Agile: Problems and Solutions"]
...the project as a vehicle of IT execution has by and large, failed to live up to its promise of predictable delivery.

[quote, Charles G. Cobb, The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach]
Agile is having a profound impact on the project management profession and will cause us to fundamentally rethink many of the well-established notions of what a project manager is...

As the above quotes indicate, there are diverse opinions on the role and importance of traditional project management in the enterprise. Clearly it is under pressure from the Agile movement. Project management professionals are advised to not deny or diminish this fact. It is possible for a modern, IT-centric organization to make considerable progress on the basis of xref:2.04.00-product-mgmt[product management] plus simple xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management], without the overhead of the formalized project lifecycle suggested by PMBOK.

Cloud is having impacts on traditional project management as well. Projects were often used to install vendor-delivered commodity software, such as for payroll or employee expense. Increasingly, as discussed in the section on xref:trad-IT-decline[the decline of traditional IT], that kind of functionality is delivered by online service providers, leaving traditional internal IT with considerably reduced responsibilities.

Some of the IT capability may remain in the guise of an internal "service broker," to assist with the sourcing and procurement of online services. The remainder moves into digital product management, as the only need for internal IT is in the area of revenue-generating, market-facing strategic product.

So, a couple questions emerge:

* Given the above trends, under what circumstances does formalized project management make economic sense?
* Assuming that formalized project management is employed, how does one retain values such as fast feedback and adaptability?

===== Scaling one product
[quote, Mike Cohn, Succeeding with Agile]
Good team structure can go a long way toward reducing dependencies but will not eliminate them.

[quote, Mark Kennaley, SDLC 3.0]
Where leveraging yellow stickies or index cards makes sense in conjunction with practices like big visible charts and co-location, such formats become ridiculous for a large constituency of challenging projects . . . When faced with these challenges, rather than proclaim that Agile won't work or doesn't scale, the preferable approach is to understand and acknowledge the nature of collaboration, the nature of distributed workflow, and the complexity of modern product development.

[quote,  Gary Hamel, preface to the Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance]
Whatâ€™s typically underestimated is the complexity and indivisibility of many large-scale coordination tasks.

As we discussed in the xref:3.07.00-Chap-7[Chapter 7], we are introducing multiple feature teams as our product scales up:

image::images/3.08-multi-feature.png[]

The decision process by which the features are identified is still informal (we will not formalize this until Chapter 12.) However, the term "architecture" is likely emerging through these discussions.

As noted in the discussion of xref:loose-coupling-project[loose coupling and project management], some needs for coordination may be mitigated through the design of the product itself. If the features and components have well defined protocols for their interaction and clear contracts for matters like performance, development on each team can move forward with some autonomy.

But at scale, complexity is inevitable. What happens when a given business objective requires coordinated effort across multiple teams?

For example, an online ecommerce site might find itself overwhelmed by business success. Upgrading the site to accommodate the new demand might require distinct work be performed by most or all of the teams:

image::images/3.08-multi-feature-coord.png[]

As the quote from Gary Hamel above indicates, a central point of coordination and accountability is advisable, otherwise the objective is at risk. (It becomes "someone else's problem.")

===== Scaling to more than one product
 disclaimer: some of this is hypothetical

In keeping with the xref:0.01-emergence[emergence model] thought experiment, another key state transition is from one product to multiple products.

This is substantially distinct from scaling one product through subdividing it into multiple features.

When everyone on the team is supporting one product and dedicated to its success, there is less sense of contention with "others" in the organization. This changes dramatically with the addition of a second product. Concerns for fair allocation and a sense of internal competition naturally arise out of this diversification. And because resources are always limited, it is critical that the demands of each product be managed using objective criteria, requiring formalization.  This was a different problem when you were a tight-knit startup; you were constrained, but everyone knew they were "in it together." Now you need some ground rules to support your increasingly diverse activities. This leads to new forms of governance.

Consider our hypothetical startup company:

image::images/3.08-one-product.png[]

Establishment of a second product team raises issues:

image::images/3.08-multi-product.png[]

* Managing scope and preventing unintended creep or drift from the product's original charter
* Managing contention for enterprise resources
* Execution to timeframes (e.g. the critical trade show)
* Coordinating dependencies (e.g. achieving larger, cross-product goals)
* Accountability for results

Fairness is deeply wired into the human brain [cites], and the creation of a new product (and associated team) provokes new dynamics in the growing company.
Project management provides tools addressing these issues, which is why it is widely used.

However, there are a number of issues in doing so.

* Projects are by definition temporary, while products may last as long as there is market demand.
* Project management methodology, with its emphasis on predictability, scope management, and change control often conflicts with the product management objective of discovering information (see the discussion of xref:2.04.04-lean-product-dev[Lean Product Development].)
** But not all product management activities involve the creation of new information!

Scope, execution, limited resources, and dependencies exist throughout digital business. A product manager with no understanding of these issues, or tools to deal with them, will likely fail. Product managers should therefore be familiar with the basic concepts of project management. The project paradigm has a benefit in its explicit limitation of time and money, and the sense of urgency this creates. However, the way in which project management is implemented, the degree of formality, will vary according to need.

So, what of project management in this new world? A project manager may still be required, to facilitate discussions, record decisions, and keep the team on track to its stated direction and commitments. Regardless of whether the team considers itself "Agile," people are sometimes bad at taking notes or being consistent in their usage of tools such as Kanban boards and standups.

It is also useful to have a third party who is knowledgeable about the product, yet has some emotional distance from its success. This can be a difficult balance to strike, but the existence of the role of Scrum coach is indicative of its importance.

===== The future of project management

Recall ultimately our three "Ps":

* Product
* Project
* Process

Taken together, the three represent a coherent set of concerns for value delivery in various forms. But in isolation, any one of them ultimately is limited. This is a particular challenge for project management, whose practitioners may invest deeply in their chosen field of expertise. The field of project management, in turn, has its own expansionist tendencies, to the point where the PMO has become the arbiter of ALL IT investments in some organizations.

A product manager who does not understand the fundamentals of project execution will not succeed...

fundamental theme - what can we know... emergence vs planning ... network vs chain ... finding partial ordering, falsifying hypotheses...

If we "get rid of the PMO" there still is the need to charter new investments. What is their value proposition, business model... there is always a portfolio and some form of success criteria and there will ALWAYS be issues of resources and dependencies

however the days of equating schedule performance with success are ending
or translating EVM directly to the balance sheet (EVM always being a fiction and less and less useful in a digitally transforming world)
