=== Chapter 8: Project & Resource Management

Project management is traditionally defined as the execution of a given scope of work within constraints of time and budget. As we have seen in our discussions of product management, in implementing truly new IT-based products, estimating time and budget can be difficult because the necessary information is not available. In fact, creating it is the actual work of the "project". Therefore, in the new Agile world, there is some uncertainty as to the role and even need for traditional project management.

However, at a practical level, project managers remain important roles and are employed at both "unicorn" and "horse" companies as overall orchestrators of complex initiatives. Financial planning has not gone away and without project management, financial planning meets difficult challenges. The very concept of having a vision becomes problematic without some ability to plan.

Because of this, this chapter also covers IT financial management at a very introductory level.

[quote,  Gary Hamel, preface to the Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance]
Whatâ€™s typically underestimated is the complexity and indivisibility of many large-scale coordination tasks.


When risk and uncertainty are present with ongoing demand, like in the case of architectural changes and related high-stake decisions, batching demand into a project for governance reasons makes sense. And when new demand (even fine-grained demand) (*** kennaley sdlc3 195)

Where leveraging yellow stickies or index cards makes sense in conjunction with practices like big visible
charts and co-location, such formats become ridiculous for a large constituency of challenging projects. For these efforts, necessity typically leads teams to stray from the established doctrine, albeit quiedy for fear of being labeled non-conformist. When faced with these challenges, rather than proclaim that Agile won't work or doesn't scale, the preferable approach is to understand and acknowledge the nature of collaboration, the nature of distributed workflow, and the complexity of modern product development.
