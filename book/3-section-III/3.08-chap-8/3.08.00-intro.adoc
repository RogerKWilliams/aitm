=== Chapter 8: Project & Resource Management

==== Introduction to Chapter 8

[quote, Project Management Body of Knowledge, version 5]
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

Project management is traditionally defined as the execution of a given scope of work within constraints of time and budget. As we have seen in our discussions of product management, in implementing truly new IT-based products, estimating time and budget can be difficult because *the necessary information is not available*. In fact, creating it is the actual work of the "project". Therefore, in the new Agile world, there is some uncertainty as to the role and even need for traditional project management.

However, at a practical level, project managers remain important roles and are employed at both "unicorn" and "horse" companies as overall orchestrators of complex initiatives. Financial planning and resource management have not gone away, and without project management financial planning meets challenges, especially regarding the efforts most critical to the business. The very concept of having a vision becomes problematic without some ability to plan.

In the emergence model thought experiment, we are making a key state transition from one product to multiple products. When everyone on the team is supporting one product and dedicated to its success, there is no sense of contention with "others." This changes dramatically with even the addition of a second product. Concerns for fair allocation and a sense of internal competition naturally arise out of this diversification. And because resources are always limited, it is critical that the demands of each product be managed using objective criteria, requiring formalization.

Much focus is given to the execution aspect of project management - its ability to help manage complex, interdependent work across resource limitations. However, we are also interested in the structural role of project management. Project management may be institutionalized through establishing an organizational function known as the PMO, which uses a project portfolio concept as a means of constraining and managing the organization's multiple priorities.

Because of these interrelated dependencies, this chapter also covers IT financial management, sourcing, and human resource management at an introductory level.

===== Project management and the organization

Consider our hypothetical startup company:

Establishment of second product team raises issues:

* Managing scope and preventing unintended creep or drift from the product's original charter
* Managing contention for enterprise resources
* Execution to timeframes
* Coordinating dependencies
* Accountability for results

Fairness is deeply wired into the human brain, and the creation of a new product (and associated team) provokes new dynamics in the growing company.
Project management provides tools addressing these issues, which is why it is widely used.

However, there are a number of issues in doing so.

* Projects are by definition temporary, while products may last as long as there is market demand.
** Not all product management activities involve the creation of new information! This chapter will discuss a variety of such issues.
* Project management methodology, with its emphasis on predictability and scope management, often conflicts with the product management objective of discovering information (see Chapter 4.)

Product managers should still be familiar with the basic concepts of project management. Scope, execution, limited resources, and dependencies exist throughout digital business
