==== Introduction to Chapter 9

What is "process?"

http://www.dictionary.com/browse/process[Dictionary.com] defines it as "a systematic series of actions directed to some end . . . a continuous action, operation, or series of changes taking place in a definite manner."

We've discussed xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management], which is an important precursor of process management. Work management is less formalized; a wide variety of activities are handled through flexible Kanban-style boards based on the simplest "process" of:

* To do
* Doing
* Done

However, the simple Kanban board can easily become much more complex, with the addition of swimlanes and additional columns, including holding areas for blocked work:

 to be redrawn

And when tasks become more routine and specialized, formal process management starts to emerge.

Process, in terms of "business process," has been a topic of study and professional development for many years. Toyota considers a clear process vision, or "target condition," to be the most fundamental objective in improving operations (<<Rother2010>>, chapters 5-6).  Designing processes, improving them, and using them to improve overall performance is an ongoing activity in most if not all organizations.

However, process can cause problems. Processes imply xref:queuing[queues], and in digital organizations this means invisible work in process. Organzational improvement approaches that encourage the formation of processes and associated metrics at all levels may therefore not be an effective model.

Nevertheless, process remains an important tool in the toolkit for organization design.

Process is a broad concept used throughout business operations. The coverage here is about process as applied to the digital organization. There is a bit of a recursive paradox here; we are talking about the process by which business processes are analyzed and automated. The degree to which this process can be seen as deterministic and repeatable is an ongoing source of controversy.
