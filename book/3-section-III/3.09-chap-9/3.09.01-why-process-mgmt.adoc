==== Why process management?
[quote, Michael Porter, Competitive Advantage]
Is a firm a collection of activities or a set of resources and capabilities? Clearly, a firm is both. But activities are what firms do, and they define the resources and capabilities that are relevant.


We have previously discussed product and project management. You may wish to review our summary description of xref:2.04.01-process-project-product[process, product, and project management].

Process management starts with the fundamental capability for coordinated xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management], and refines it much further.

In our company, work has been specializing. A simple card-based kanban approach is no longer sufficient. We are finding that some work is repetitive, and we need to remember to do certain things in certain orders.

For example, a new Human Resources (HR) manager was hired. The HR manager decided that a simple Kanban card of "hire someone new for us" was not sufficient. As she pointed out to the team, hiring needed to follow a defined sequence of tasks:

* Establishing the need and purpose for the position
* Soliciting candidates
* Filtering the candidates
* Selecting a final choice
* Registering that new employee in the payroll system
* Getting the new employee set up with benefits providers (insurance, retirement, etc)
* Getting the new employee working space, equipment, and access to systems
* Training the new employee in organizational policies as well as any position-specific orientation

The sales, marketing, and finance teams have similarly been developing ordered lists of tasks that are consistently executed as end to end sequences. And even in the core digital development and operations teams, they are finding that some tasks are repetitive and need documentation so they are performed consistently.

More broadly, your entire digital product pipeline is sometimes called a "process." From initial feature idea through production, you seek a consistent means for identifying and implementing valuable functionality. Sometimes this work requires intensive, iterative collaboration and is unpredictable (e.g. developing a user interface); sometimes, the work is more repeatable (e.g. packaging and releasing tested functionality).

However, some team members are cautious of the word "process". The term "process police" comes up in an unhappy way. "Are we going to have auditors tracking whether we filled out all our forms correctly?," one asks. "We used to get these consultants in at my old company and they would leave piles of 3 ring binders on the shelf that no-one ever looked at," another person says.

The irony is that digital products are based on process automation. The idea that certain tasks can be done repeatably and at scale through digitization is fundamental to all use of computers:

* ride sharing applications
* electronic mail transmission
* "Hire Employee" as an automated transaction in a Human Resource Management System

To repeat, the digital service *is* fundamentally an automated process. That's what computers do.

===== From work to process management

So, the kanban board has started to elaborate. We're seeing more and more work that needs to follow a sequence, or checklist... Wait, didn't we see that in the chapter on Project Management?

We discussed task ordering in Chapter 8. However, projects are not usually seen as repeatable. Process management is when we need to start managing multiple processes and considering their interdependencies, perhaps using common methods to define them and even common tooling to support multiple processes. The following diagram might help:

Project management adds concerns of task ordering and resource management, for projects typically executed on a one-time basis. Process management is also concerned with ordering, but less so with the resource load (more on this below), and instead is concerned with repeatability and ongoing improvement.

Project management and process management interact in 2 primary ways:

* Projects often are used to create and deploy processes. A large system implementation (e.g. of a Enterprise Resource Planning module such as Human Resource Management) will often be responsible for process implementation including training.
* As environments mature, projects require process support. As Richardson notes in _Project Management Theory and Practice_, "there are many organizational processes that are needed to optimally support a successful project." <<Richardson2010>> For example, the project may require predictable contractor hiring, or infrastructure provisioning, or security reviews. To the extent these are managed as repeatable, optimized processes, project risk is reduced.

===== Process and organization
Processes are much more than repeatable activities. Many leading thinkers (such as Michael Porter, quoted at the start of this chapter section) see organizations primarily as sets of interacting processes, supporting fundamental end to end value chains or value streams. We will talk more about this in the next chapter section.

The concept of process is often contrasted with that of function or organization. We have seen in previous chapters how product development and project management must drive results across organizational boundaries. Process management has a similar challenge; its goal is to drive *repeatable* results across organizational boundaries.

As we know from our discussion of product management, developing new products is not a particularly repeatable process. The Agile movement in some ways arose in opposition to attempts to apply process concepts of "repeatability" to developing software. These concerns remain.

However, this book is not only about digital R&D processes. It is also about a spectrum of operations and effort that spans from the unique to the highly repeatable. There is an interesting middle ground, of processes that are semi-repeatable, more repeatable than the stereotypically non-deterministic development process.

We will talk about a wide variety of such processes in the chapter section on process frameworks.

===== "Business" vs "IT" process


===== Process as a vehicle for industry understanding
As we discussed at the beginning of this chapter, sometimes new employees come in expecting that you are following certain processes. This is in part because "process" experience can be an important part of an employee's career background. A skilled HR manager may consider their experience with large-scale enterprise hiring processes to be a major part of their qualifications for a position in your company.
