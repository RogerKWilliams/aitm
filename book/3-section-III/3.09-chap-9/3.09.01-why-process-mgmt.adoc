==== Why process management?
[quote, Don Reinertsen, Managing the Design Factory pp. 197-198]
The first question is, why control the process? When we know why, it almost automatically clarifies how we must control the process. Is a controlled process inherently better than one that has more uncertainty? No. Since the purpose of our process is to make money, it would follow that the purpose of controlling the process must be to influence economic outcomes. There is no other reason to be interested in process control.

We have previously discussed product and project management. You may wish to review our summary description of xref:2.04.01-process-project-product[process, product, and project management].

Process management starts with the fundamental capability for coordinated xref:2.05.00-work-management[work management], and refines it much further.

In our company, work has been specializing. A simple card-based kanban approach is no longer sufficient. We are finding that some work is repetitive, and we need to remember to do certain things in certain orders.

For example, a new Human Resources (HR) manager was hired. The HR manager decided that a simple Kanban card of "hire someone new for us" was not sufficient. As she pointed out to the team, hiring needed to follow a defined sequence of tasks:

* Establishing the need and purpose for the position
* Soliciting candidates
* Filtering the candidates
* Selecting a final choice
* Registering that new employee in the payroll system
* Getting the new employee set up with benefits providers (insurance, retirement, etc)
* Getting the new employee working space, equipment, and access to systems
* Training the new employee in organizational policies as well as any position-specific orientation

The sales, marketing, and finance teams have similarly been developing ordered lists of tasks that are consistently executed as end to end sequences. And even in the core digital development and operations teams, they are finding that some tasks are repetitive and need documentation so they are performed consistently.

More broadly, your entire digital product pipeline is sometimes called a "process." From initial feature idea through production, you seek a consistent means for identifying and implementing valuable functionality. Sometimes this work requires intensive, iterative collaboration and is unpredictable (e.g. developing a user interface); sometimes, the work is more repeatable (e.g. packaging and releasing tested functionality).

However, some team members are cautious of the word "process". The term "process police" comes up in an unhappy way. "Are we going to have auditors tracking whether we filled out all our forms correctly?," one asks. "We used to get these consultants in at my old company and they would leave piles of 3 ring binders on the shelf that no-one ever looked at," another person says.

The irony is that digital products are based on process automation. The idea that certain tasks can be done repeatably and at scale through digitization is fundamental to all use of computers:

* ride sharing applications
* electronic mail transmission
* "Hire Employee" as an automated transaction in a Human Resource Management System

To repeat, the digital service *is* fundamentally an automated process. That's what computers do.

===== From work to process management

So, the kanban board has started to elaborate. We're seeing more and more work that needs to follow a sequence, or checklist... Wait, didn't we see that in Project Mgmt?

We discussed task ordering in Chapter 8. However, projects are not usually seen as repeatable. Process management is when we need to start managing multiple processes and considering their interdependencies, perhaps using common methods to define them and even common tooling to support multiple processes. The following diagram might help:

Project management adds concerns of task ordering and resource management, for projects typically executed on a one-time basis. Process management is also concerned with ordering, but less so with the resource load (more on this below), and instead is concerned with repeatability and ongoing improvement.

Project management and process management interact in 2 primary ways:

* Projects often are used to create and deploy processes. A large system implementation (e.g. of a Enterprise Resource Planning module such as Human Resource Management) will often be responsible for process implementation including training.
* As environments mature, projects require process support. As Richardson notes in _Project Management Theory and Practice_, "there are many organizational processes that are needed to optimally support a successful project." <<Richardson2010>> For example, the project may require predictable contractor hiring, or infrastructure provisioning, or security reviews. To the extent these are managed as repeatable, optimized processes, project risk is reduced. 



the difference is that in PM, the checklist is usually re-created every time. Process mgmt re-uses.

* Self-organizing (kanban) processes vs. formalized process frameworks.

===== Process vs organization
Will functions stay with product centricity?

Need an overall concept of product/project/process

<<Cohn2010>> p144 assumes functional mgrs will stay

perils of "take a number" service-ization


===== Self-organization and process
Control vs ...

* "Process" at Toyota (Rother)


===== "Business" vs "IT" process


===== Measuring process

Measuring process. KPIs across a 36-process operating model?
