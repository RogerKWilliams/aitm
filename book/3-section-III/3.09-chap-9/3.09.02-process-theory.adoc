==== Process management practices
[quote, Don Reinertsen, Managing the Design Factory pp. 197-198]
The first question is, why control the process? When we know why, it almost automatically clarifies how we must control the process. Is a controlled process inherently better than one that has more uncertainty? No. Since the purpose of our process is to make money, it would follow that the purpose of controlling the process must be to influence economic outcomes. There is no other reason to be interested in process control.

===== BPM fundamentals
We've discussed some of the factors leading to the need for process management, but we haven't yet come to grips with what it *is*.

Process management is grounded in business fundamentals. Businesses convert inputs (capital, materials, staff talent) into valuable outputs and generate valuable surplus (margin) for shareholders and other stakeholders.

This act of *conversion* is a *process*. The overall process has been described by Michael Porter as a "value chain."

image::images/3.09-valCh.png[]
Value Chain similar to <<Porter1998>>.

Note the progression along the bottom: first, raw materials are acquired, then manufactured, then distributed at which point they are marketed and sold, and ultimately serviced. Porter termed this set of activities "Primary."

The upper half represents what Porter termed "support." Supporting activities represent necessary, but not value adding, functions.

There are many criticisms of the Porter value chain. Without research and development, there is no product, so why is it considered a support activity? Surely, marketing and sales help drive demand for the product, especially with manufacturing lead times shrinking, so why do they appear so late in the game?

Overall, the model represents a manufacturing-centric world where customers were happy to buy what was on offer.

However, this does not change the fact that most value has some rough ordering to it (it is difficult to sell and service a product before you invent and produce it), and the idea that some activities are primary while others are supporting also is useful.

The value chain as a whole is high level. We can think of a large company in these terms, but we cannot easily manage it this way. Value chains therefore are the ultimate "process" but in order for process to have value, we need to take it down a level or two.

In order to do this, we should clarify some terms.

===== Process and related terms

The following terms often appear in discussions of process:

* Function
* Capability
* Practice

We will use the following definitions:
*Process*: event-driven, value-add sequence
*Capability*: general term for a capacity or potential
*Practice*: set of norms, guidelines, professional identity

We will say that a capability may be implemented by a process, function, or practice.

A *process* is an ordered, countable set of activities; an event-driven, value-adding sequence that can be measured and improved. The following terms often are used to describe processes or their components:

* Value chain
* Value stream
* Business process
* Workflow
* Procedure
* Task
* Step

Processes *cross* functions.

Visually, processes are often represented with chevrons, like Porter's original value chain:

*Functions* are unordered, steady state domains of activity. An organizational chart often can be based on various functions. Functions also often imply hierarchy. They are more difficult to measure or improve; usually, improving a function means improving some process it owns or performs.

Functions, especially when they are closely aligned to an organizational structure, may be represented as a hierarchy:

The following two terms are also unordered, but have different connotations from function:

* Capability
* Service (sometimes)

A *capability* is a generic term for a capacity or potential
A *service* is a transactional act of value, simultaneously produced and delivered (more on this later)

Finally, the concept of *practice* has the following characteristics: It is the least formalized of the concepts. It represents a loose, conceptual area that may represent a community of interest (for example, a Java community of interest). It's not usually measured or tracked for improvement. Some topics may start as a practice and formalize into a function, for example Capacity management.

To repeat: we say that an IT management capability may be implemented by a process, function, or practice

===== Naming

Processes, as a best practice, are named with active verbs.

===== Process notation
It's not all about this

ordering, synch, conditionality

also seen in general treatments of mgmt, project mgmt, etc - also EA/BizArch

but most refined in process approaches

RACI
focus on specific decisions rather than abstract concepts like empowerment and strong vs. weak teams. It is much more useful for teams to know which product features they can change without outside approval than it is to find out they are "empowered."

reinertsen has stuff on this

===== Process granularity
[quote, Alex Sharp, Workflow Modeling]
One organization enthusiastically embraced process improvement, with good reason: customers, suppliers, and employees found the company's processes slow, inconsistent, and error prone. Unfortunately, they were so enthusiastic that each team defined the work of their small group or department as a complete process. Of course, each of these was in fact the contribution of a specialized functional group to some larger, but unidentified, processes. Each of these "processes" was "improved" independently, and you can guess what happened. +
 +
 Within the boundaries of each process, improvements were implemented that made work more efficient from the perspective of the performer. However, these mini-processes were efficient largely because they had front-end constraints that made work easier for the performer but imposed a burden on the customer or the preceding process. The attendant delay and effort meant that the true business processes behaved even more poorly than they had before. This is a common outcome when processes are defined too "small." Moral: Don't confuse subprocesses or activities with business processes.

If processes are connected on a 1:1 basis, then we say that they are part of a single, end-to-end, business process.

CPRET is a mnemonic for the basic definition of process in process engineering: it stands for Constraints, Product, Resources, input Elements and Transformation which are the basic components of a process. In process engineering, a process is a suite of transformations of elements into a given output (product) given a set of constraints and resources. From this definition, we can see that technology has a strong influence on the process: the transformation part is a clear function of the technology available as input and resources in IT are strongly influenced by the technology used. As we mostly deal with information and data in IT management processes, the type of data available is either helping or impeding the transformation part.
