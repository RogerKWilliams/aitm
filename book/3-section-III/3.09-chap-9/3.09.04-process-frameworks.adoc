So, what is a "framework?"

The term process framework" is generally used to characterize comprehensive
and systematic representations of a major business area by focusing on its activities. The first goal of any framework is to be Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) - that is, for a given conceptual space, provide a "map" that outlines the boundaries and covers the entire space. You are either doing Incident OR Change Or Release 0 R one of several dozen other processes, and there
should be no "in the cracks" concerns.

Ve ndo rs, co nsulting firms, and academics have been apply ing analyses of va r-
ious types to IT itself for yea rs. Many framewo rks have em erged to help und er-
stand the overall problem . (See th e section "What is a process fram ewo rk ?"
earlier in this chapter.) The three major fram ewo rks hav ing th e most effect
on enterprise IT in th e United States at this writing are CO Brr"', CMMI " ,
and ITIL "', altho ugh there are other public and semi pub I ic fram ewo rks such
as the App lication Services Library, Business In formation Servi ces Library,
and Info rm ati o n Systems Procurem ent Libra ry, as well as less formalized pub-
lish ing ho use li braries and propri etary fram eworks owned by th e major consul-
tancies and research firms .
COB IT<8>, ITIL <8>, and CMM I<8> provide significant perspecti ves o n major o ngoing
capabil ities and fun ctions th at the large IT o rgan iza tion must perform and in
general are developed fro m the perspective of steady-state functi o ns, as o pposed
to a value strea m or rigorous process perspective. (Agai n, revi ew lheir major
concepts and ask yo urself which are "countable." ) Alo ng with the value stream
ana lys is presented in th e previo us cha pter, they serve as useful statem ents of
requirem ents for the data, system , and pattern analysis in the next chapters.

In closing, IT capability frameworks can be harmful if they lead to fragmen-
tation of improvement effort and lack of focus on the flow of IT value. In
the imagery of Eli Goldratt, the problem with CMMI@, COBITÂ®, and mL <II>
is that they do not help you find the heavy Boy Scout. They don't point
you towards the IT equivalent of the $2 million computerized machine
tool that actually reduced the plant's profitability. And it seems likely that
large-scale IT might be vulnerable to such constraints.
So, the synthesized capability framework in the following section is presented
with the caution that although it serves as a reasonable consensus representa-
tion of all of the major concerns one encounters in the large IT organization, it
is distinct from and subordinate to the process architecture.

===== Continuous improvement frameworks

===== IT management frameworks

====== Process vs function in the frameworks

====== ITIL

====== COBIT

====== TOGAF

====== IT4IT

====== The particular case of CMMI

Process capability is the
inherent variation of the process in relation to the specification limits. The smaller
the process variation, the better the process's capability. <<Kan1995>>

===== Process "Maturity" and "quality"

what is maturity? Cooke-Davis defines this as "the extent to which an organization has explicitly and consistently deployed processes that are documented, managed, measured, controlled, and continually improved" (Cooke-Davies, 2004). <<Richardson2010>>

====== Other frameworks
