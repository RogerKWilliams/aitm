==== Product and function

[quote, Sriram Narayan, Agile IT Organization Design]
Even where they are not part of a value stream, activity-oriented teams tend to standardize their operations over time. Their appetite for offering custom solutions begins to diminish. Complaints begin to surface—“ They threw the rule book at us,” “What bureaucracy!”

By this time, you probably detect that there is a fundamental tension between functional specialization and end to end value delivery. This tension is the topic of endless research, articles, books, and commentary, in the mainstream business press and more specialized channels. The tension may go by different names:

* flow vs resource
* process vs silo
* line vs staff (which has some additional connotations)

===== Efficiency versus flow

Here is an interesting depiction of one dysfunctional pattern that can emerge in navigating this tension:

*Flow vs effiency, from http://www.slideshare.net/gosei/coordination-chaos*

The above slide is worth a careful examination. The idea is that the more effective you are at product flow, the further to the right you are. The more efficient you are with your resources, the further up you are. It is easy to be completely efficient with resources, and have no flow. It is also possible to be very good at flow, but at the cost of little resource efficiency. Being excellent at both, however, is impossible - there is an outer boundary.

Also, there is an interesting dynamic if you seek too much resource efficiency. Loading staff more and more heavily has counterproductive results, in which flow actually decreases, and the resulting "coordination chaos" also decreases resource efficiency in a vicious reinforcing feedback loop.

===== Examining the problem more deeply
Graphics such as the previous one are limited in insight. What are the particular organizational forms and practices in question? We will spend some time thinking through this.

Don Reinertsen devotes considerable thought to this problem in both  _Developing Products in Half the Time_ and _Managing the Design Factory._

As we saw previously <<2.04.01-process-project-product>>, there are three major tools used to achieve end to end flow across functional areas:

* Process
* Project
* Product

For example, some manufacturing can be represented as a very simple, sequential process model:

image::images/3.07-naive-mfg.png[]

The product is already defined and the need to generate information (i.e. through feedback) is at an absolute minimum. Functional areas can continually increase their efficiency and economies of scale through deep specialization.

NOTE: Even in this simplest model, feedback is important. Much of the evolution of 20th century manufacturing has been in challenging this naive, open-loop model. (Remember our brief discussion of open-loop? <<link>>)

The original, open-loop waterfall model of IT systems implementation was arguably based on just such a naive concept:

image::images/3.07-waterfall.png[]

(Review chapter 3 <<link>> for more of this history.)

There are two primary disadvantages to this model:

* It discourages closed-loop feedback
* The transactional friction of each handoff

The model falls into what we characterized as the "original sin" of IT management: confusing production with product development  <<link>>. As a repeatable production model, it may work, assuming that there is little or no information left to generate regarding the production process (an increasingly questionable assumption in and of itself).

But when applied to product development, where the *primary goal* is the generation of information, the model is inappropriate and has led to innumerable failures. This includes software development, and even implementing purchased packages in complex environments.

Turning to the problem of transactional friction:

This problem is distinct from the problem of feedback. It is also a bit more obvious on a tactical level. The most common response is project management.

To understand how project management works across a functionally organized system, consider the internals of each functional area:

image::images/3.07-mfg-w-resource.png[]

Each combination of worker and equipment can be considered a workstation in this simplified model.

If there is concern for flow across the functional areas, one technique used in manufacturing is that of expediting. The expeditor tracks the process across the work stations and ensures that any friction or blockages are overcome so that the entire process completes and value is delivered. This can be seen as a preliminary form of project management.

As the production line evolves, scheduling may be used as well: the assignment of work to each workstation (combination of worker and equipment) may have its timing and duration specified in advance. While this is not an optimal approach according to Lean philosophy (which emphasizes "pull" techniques), production scheduling is widely used in manufacturing.

NOTE: Production scheduling is a large topic in and of itself. It is part of the domain of interest of the professional organization, The American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS).

IT systems development, when crossing functions, is rarely if ever considered as a simple end to end process that can run itself, with only a lightweight expeditor. Instead, since there is substantially increased complexity, a project paradigm is used across the functions. The project manager plays the role of expanded expeditor:

image::images/3.07-sw-w-resource.png[]

The above diagram, which you should study carefully, is a more detailed representation of the classic "waterfall" project. It still bears strong similarities to manufacturing; in particular, notice that the default model is that the need for the resource is tightly bounded by the calendar. In the above model, the following resource requirements are apparent:

. One Requirements analyst is needed between times A and B (e.g, from May 1 through 15).
. One Architect is needed between times B and C (e.g., from May 16 through 31)
. One Developer is needed between times C and D (e.g., from June 1 through 15)
. One Release Engineer is needed between times D and E (e.g., from June 15 through 30)

*This is a deliberaly unworkable model for illustration.* (But the author can attest that it has been tried...) Obviously, if the Developer is released from the project on June 15, and issues were to arise on June 20 with the release, flow would be interrupted and the system would not be delivered successfully.

Because of this, the project may retain some residual claim on all the engaged resources, but their utilization may be low or zero at certain points. Pivoting the above diagram 90 degrees, we start to develop an understanding of the interrelatedness of product development:

image::images/3.07-overlapping.png[]

NOTE: The above diagram resembles the Rational Unified Process <<link>>. This is deliberate. RUP is notable as an early and widely publicized illustration of these matters.

The project manager is expected to manage the uncertain handoffs between the various functional areas, and anticipate resource requirements stemming from unexpected feedback demands.

 [the above section should probably move to chapter 8]



Adapting a services model to improve flow


(Notice that the services a functional area provides can be viewed as a form of product in and of themselves.)







[quote, Don Reinertsen, Managing the Design Factory]
Companies that experiment with autonomous teams learn their lessons, and conclude that the disadvantages are significant. Then they try to combine the advantages of the functional form with those of the autonomous team.

How to structure the matrix

RACI

focus on specific decisions rather than abstract concepts like empowerment and strong vs. weak teams. It is much more useful for teams to know which product features they can change without outside approval than it is to find out they are "empowered."

===== Specialists
The danger in using specialists lies in their low
involvement in individual projects and the multitude of tasks competing for their time.
