==== What is IT value?

Consider the following scenario:

A woman is wondering if she can afford to dine out that evening. She uses her mobile device to access her banking information and determines that in fact she does have enough money to do so. She also uses her mobile device to make a reservation and contact some friends to join her. Finally, she uses the navigation capabilities of that device to avoid heavy traffic, arriving at the restaurant in time for an enjoyable evening with her friends.

Information technology pervaded this experience. The origins, layers and complex connections of the distributed systems involved are awe-inspiring to consider.

*Don't worry about the technological terms for now*

This is an introductory text. You may see terms below that are unfamiliar (Model-View-Controller, IP, packet switching). If you are reading this on line, you can follow the links, but it's not required.

As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it's important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time.

You should be able to understand the gist presented below, that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technology, some of it old, some of it new.

The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a Model-View-Controller framework, implemented in the latest version of Javascript, running on an interpreter that would have taxed a mainframe thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by 4G LTE data which in turn relies on the high-volume IP backbone networks operated by the telecommunications carriers, based on research into packet switching now approaching 50 years’ old.

The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure middleware, crossing multiple network control points, which talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system which still runs on the mainframe, now the latest version of IBM’s zOS system but still based on code written in the lowest level assembler. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency and, although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio has to date not been justifiable.

The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large Cloud data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the languages are newer, the database is structured very differently, and the operating system is Linux.

Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.

The resulting value is clear. In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means. The phone line at the restaurant might have been busy, so she might have risked showing up with no reservation. Before texting and social media, she might not have been able to reach her friends as easily. Without the traffic application she might have run into a huge midtown traffic jam and been half an hour late. Clearly, IT added value to her life and helped her maximize her experiences of social enjoyment.

_Discuss: How does information technology contribute to your enjoyment of life and experiences of value?_
