What is IT value?

Consider the following scenario:

A woman is wondering if she can afford to dine out that evening. She uses her mobile device to access her banking information and determines that in fact she does have enough money to do so. She also uses her mobile device to make a reservation and contact some friends to join her. Finally, she uses the navigation capabilities of that device to avoid heavy traffic, arriving at the restaurant in time for an enjoyable evening with her friends.
Information technology pervaded this experience. The origins, layers and complex connections of the distributed systems involved are awe-inspiring to consider.
The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a Model-View-Controller framework, implemented in the latest version of Javascript, running on an interpreter that would have taxed a mainframe thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by 4G LTE data which in turn relies on the high-volume IP backbone networks operated by the telecommunications carriers, based on research into packet switching now approaching 50 years’ old.
The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure middleware, crossing multiple network control points, which talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system which still runs on the mainframe, now the latest version of IBM’s zOS system but still based on assembly code. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency and, although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio has to date not been justifiable.
The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large Cloud data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the languages are newer, the database is structured very differently, and the operating system is Linux.
Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.
The resulting value is clear. In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means. The phone line at the restaurant might have been busy, so she might have risked showing up with no reservation. Before texting and social media, she might not have been able to reach her friends as easily. Without the traffic application she might have run into a huge midtown traffic jam and been half an hour late. Clearly, IT added value to her life and helped her maximize her experiences of social enjoyment.
But who paid for her enjoyment? The bank and restaurant both had clear motivation for supporting a better on line experience, and people now expect that service organizations provide this. The bank experiences less customer turnover and increased likelihood that customers add additional services. The restaurant sees increased traffic and smoother flow from more efficient reservations. Both see increased competitiveness.
The traffic application is a somewhat different story. While it is an engineering marvel, there is still some question as to how to fund it long term. It requires a large user based to operate, and yet end users are unlikely to pay for it. At this writing, the service draws on advertising dollars from businesses wishing to advertise to passersby, and also sells its real-time data on traffic patterns to a variety of customers, such as developers considering investments along given routes.
So, what is IT value? I suggest the following:

IT Value is found in qualifying the organization or individual to participate effectively (maximize utility, in economic terms) in information-rich environments. If the situation is competitive, it also consists of elevating their performance above peers.
