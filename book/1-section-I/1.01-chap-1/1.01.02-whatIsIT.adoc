==== Defining IT, and IT value

We’ve started this book in the previous section, by first defining IT value. This is deliberate. But what is IT, anyways?

* The computers? The networks?
* The people who run them?
* That organization that loves to say “no” and is always slow and expensive?

None of these are how this book defines “IT.” Although this is not a technical book on computer science or software engineering, the intent is that it reflects and is compatible with academic theory.

Therefore, “information technology” is defined as the edifice of theory and practice based on the work of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon[Claude Shannon], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing[Alan Turing], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church[Alonzo Church], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann[John von Neumann], and the other pioneers who defined the central problems of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory[information theory], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics[digital logic],  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability[computability], and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture[computer architecture].

Information technology (”IT” for the rest of this book) increasingly permeates business operations and social interactions (figure XX). As it increases its pervasiveness, it becomes difficult to disentangle and analyze it. However, doing so remains essential. Without a line of sight back to its intellectual foundations, any technology risks becoming magic, and its users risk becoming a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult[cargo cult].

*Sidebar: Cargo cult*

During World War II, South Pacific native peoples had been exposed abruptly to modern technological society with the Japanese and US occupations of their islands. Occupying forces would often provide food, tobacco, and luxuries to the natives to ease relations. After the war, various tribes were observed creating simulated airports and airplanes, and engaging in various rituals that superficially looked like air traffic signaling and other operations associated with a military air base.

On further investigation, it became clear that the natives were seeking more “cargo” and had developed a magical understanding of how goods would be delivered. By imitating the form of what they had seen, they hoped to rec⁠1reate it.

In 1974, the noted physicist Richard Feynman gave a speech at Caltech in which he coined the immortal phrase “cargo cult science.” His intent was to caution against activities which appear to follow the external form of science, but lack the essential understanding at its core.

It should be noted, as with most archetypes of this sort, that there are questions around the accuracy of the original accounts and Western interpretations and mythmaking around what was seen. However there is no question that the phenomena were observed. There is also no doubt that “cargo cult thinking” is a useful cautionary metaphor.

Nicholas Carr, in his controversial _Harvard Business Review_ article "IT Doesn't Matter," recognized that IT was becoming commoditized in an important sense. As Cloud providers started to offer utility-style computing, the choice of vendors like HP vs IBM was no longer strategic. Looking to history, Carr argued that just as business no longer have “Vice Presidents for Electricity,” so businesses no longer need Chief Information Officers or dedicated IT departments.

Carr’s hypothesis has insight -- there is no question IT is becoming pervasive -- but ultimately reflects a narrow view of what “IT” is. If “IT” were merely computation at the lowest level -- just shuffling bits of information around, doing a little math -- then perhaps it could be embedded throughout a business like electricity. But IT has emergent aspects that are not comparable to electrical power. As it pervades all dimensions of business operations, it brings its concerns with it: complexity, fragility, and the skills required to cope with them. It also radically transforms industries: from retail to transportation to manufacturing to genetics, applied, software-centric IT is unleashing remarkable economic disruption.

A lawyer may depend on a cell phone, and (in keeping with Carr) beyond its provision as a commodity service needs little else to deliver the legal strategies a firm needs. A graphic designer may use computerized graphic tools, but these have become relatively standardized and commoditized in the past twenty years, and probably are not a source of competitive advantage in the quest for new marketing clients.

On the other hand, consider a text analytic algorithm that replaces dozens of paralegals, resulting in order-of-magnitude more accurate legal research in a fraction of cost and time. This *is* strategic and disruptive to the legal community. A superior supply chain algorithm, and the ability to improve it on an ongoing basis, may indeed elevate a logistics firm’s performance above competitors. In cases like these -- and they seem to be increasing -- IT matters very much.

In the digitally transforming economy, traditional “back office” IT organizations find themselves called on to envision, develop, and support market-facing applications of IT. And what starts with one market-facing use case can quickly expand into entire portfolios.  It is such cases that this book is particularly concerned with.

So, how do we define an IT problem, as opposed to other kinds of business problems? An IT problem is any problem where you are primarily constrained by your capability and understanding of IT.

* If you need computer scientists or engineers who understand the fundamentals of information theory and computer science, you are doing IT.
* If you need people who understand when your information-centric problems might need to be referred to such theorists and engineers, you are likely doing IT.
* If you need people who are skilled in building upon those fundamentals,  and operating technical platforms derived from them (such as programming languages, general purpose computers, and routers), you are doing IT.

And regardless of where the IT is housed (under a traditional CIO, an operations capability, a Chief Marketing Officer, or a “line of business”),  when it is critical to operations, certain concerns inevitably follow:

* Requirements (i.e. your intent for IT)
* Sourcing and provisioning
* IT-centric product design and construction
* Configuration and change management
* Support
* Improvement

Executives who take control of information technology in hopes of making it more agile are often surprised to find that these concerns were not mere bureaucracy, but instead had well grounded origins in past failures. Ignoring these lessons is perilous.

And yet, the traditional, process-heavy IT organization does seem dysfunctional from a business point of view: a central theme of this book.

*Sidebar: Corporate function vs. problem domain*

Discussions of “information technology” become contentious because some think of the traditional organization, while others think of the general problem area.

IT has a long history as a corporate function, a single hierarchy under a powerful Chief Information Officer. This model has had its dysfunctions, including a longstanding reputation for being slow and expensive. Often, when one encounters the term “IT,” the author using the termf is referring to this organizational tradition.

*We are less interested in the future of IT as a distinct organizational structure. There are many different models, from fully centralized to fully embedded.* Organizational structure will be discussed in Chapter 7.

For this book, we define “Information technology” in terms of its historic origins. We look to IT’s common origins in automating the laborious and error prone processes of computation, through the application of digital logic technologies based on information transmission.

Regardless of organizational form or delivery methods, IT is defined by these origins. And there are notable common threads through this problem domain: the fragility and complexity of these systems, the need for layered abstractions in their management, and more.

It does not matter if the application developers ultimately report up through the CIO, the CMO, the CFO, or the COO. Their daily experience remains largely the same. The dynamics of their management remain the same. Executives who seek to take control of IT so they can “remove that old bureaucracy” are well advised to be cautious; the bureaucracy emerged for a reason. More on this in subsequent chapters.
