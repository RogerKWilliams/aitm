==== Policy-based approaches
DRAFT
 [As of fall 2015 this section needs to be elaborated.]

Before we turned to source control, we had looked at a simple script that changed the configuration of a computer. It did so in an _imperative_ fashion.

NOTE: *Imperative vs Declarative.* These are two important terms from computer science. [Define.]

A script such as iac.sh is executed line by line, i.e., it is imperative. But in policy-based approaches, the object is to define the desired end state of the resource, not the steps needed to get there.

Chef, Puppet, Salt Stack, and Ansible are all declarative to some degree.

This is a complex topic and there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. (See http://markburgess.org/blog_order.html["When and Where Order Matters"] by Mark Burgess for an advanced discussion.) But policy-based approaches seem to have the upper hand for now.
