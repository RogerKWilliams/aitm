==== Infrastructure overview

In the previous chapter, you developed a product idea and a proposed Minimum Marketable Feature. Some part of that Minimum Marketable Feature requires writing software, or at least configuring some IT-centric system. (IT being defined as in Chapter 1.)

You presumably have some resources (time and money). It’s Monday morning, you have cleared all distractions; shut down your Twitter and Facebook feeds, and are ready to start building.

Not so fast.

Before you can start writing code, you need some kind of a platform. You need to decide what language you are going to write in, or what framework you are going to configure, and how that effort is going to result in an operational system capable of rendering IT services.
`
`You are probably swimming in a sea of advice and options regarding your technical choices. In previous decades, books such as this might have gone into the specifics of particular platforms: mainframe vs. minicomputers, COBOL vs Fortran, Windows vs Unix, etc.

At this writing, JavaScript is a leading choice, in conjunction with various frameworks and NoSQL options (e.g. the MEAN stack, for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js), but millions of developers are still writing Java and .Net, and Ruby and Python have significant followings. Linux is arguably the leading platform, but commercial Unix and Microsoft platforms are still strong. And, periodically it's reported that the majority of the world's transactions *still* run on COBOL-based systems.

However, in the past few years, some powerful infrastructure concepts have solidified that are independent of particular platforms:

* Automation and “infrastructure as code”
* The centrality of source control
* The importance of package management
* Policy-based infrastructure management

(We'll get to test-driven development & DevOps in the next chapter.)

This might seem like a detour - you are in a hurry to start writing code! But industry practice is clear. You check your code into source control from Day One. You define your server configurations as recipes, manifests, or at least shell scripts, and check those definitions into source control as well. You keep track of what you have downloaded from the Internet and what version of stuff you are using. Always downloading the “latest” package from its upstream creator might seem like the way to stay current, but it will kill you when stuff works on one server but not on another.

So, you need to understand a few things and make a few decisions, that you will be living with for a while, and will not be easily changed.

*Sidebar: What is Infrastructure?*
Infrastructure is a tricky word. Google defines it thus:

￼_The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, and power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise._

In general, it connotes the stuff behind the scenes, the things you need but don’t want to spend a lot of time thinking about.

We will spend a lot of time examining what we mean by “infrastructure” in this book, as it is fundamental to understanding the “business of IT.”

This book defines “IT infrastructure” recursively as “the set of IT concerns that are of particular interest to IT.”

* An application or business service is consumed by people who are NOT primarily concerned with IT. For example, a customer-facing online banking service is consumed by end users.

* An IT infrastructure service is a service consumed by other IT-centric teams and capabilities. For example, a database or a load balancing service is consumed by other IT teams.

IT infrastructure is one form of infrastructure. Other kinds of infrastructure might include mechanical, electrical, and plant investments (ME & P). IT infrastructure, like IT itself, is defined by its fundamental dependence on information and computing theory [link Chapter 1].

The interesting thing is that today’s application becomes tomorrow’s infrastructure. Forty years ago, building an “application” would have included building its database, perhaps even its file management. This was rightly determined to be a general-case problem that could be the basis for commodity software, and so companies like Oracle were born.

Operating systems took on more and more functionality, technology became more and more reliable and easily configured, and once unique (and competitively differentiating) functionality became commoditized and more and more deeply buried in the “stack”: the IT infrastructure.

==== From "physical" compute to Cloud

What do we even mean by “Cloud”?

First we need to understand what we mean by IT

* Computing cycles
* Memory & storage
* Communications

Those are the fundamentals

The idea of running IT as a utility service goes back years

* Complexity has been the problem

Cloud origins

* Virtualization (we will discuss further)
* Managed hosting
* Web-scale IT
* “IT doesn’t matter”

Virtualizaton

* Essentially, a computer within a computer.

* There is a host system that can instantiate one or more guests.
 - The host system knows about the guests, but the guests do not know about the host (except as a peer system on the network, perhaps).
 - The physical resources allocated can vary according to demand

* The technical details are deep. Talk to your
OS instructor.

****
*Did you know?*

Virtualization was predicted in the earliest theories that led to the development of computers. Turing and Church realized that any general purpose computer could emulate any other. Virtual systems have existed in some form since (IBM LPAR?).
****

* Multi-tenancy
 - Multi-tenancy is where multiple customers share physical resources that provide the illusion of being dedicated
 - The phone system has been multi-tenant ever since they got rid of party lines.


Virtualization vs containers

Virtualization benefits

Why virtualize?

* Great for heterogeneous workloads – lots of miscellaneous applications & services running on underutilized servers
* What about where the application is large and virtualization is mostly overhead?
 - Still may make sense
* Management consistency
* Ease of restoration
* Database professionals still don’t like it
 - “The database IS virtualization” they will say

Virtualizaiton vs cloud

* “Cloud is not just virtualization” many critics will say
* Financial model
* Tenancy model
* Provisioning model
* Services beyond raw compute, storage and network
* Self-service, API-driven

Traditional managed hosting vs cloud
* Managed services: “your mess for less”
* Cloud: “clean it up first”
