==== From "physical" compute to Cloud

According to the http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf[National Institute for Standards and Technology], Cloud is:

****
_a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction._
****

Before Cloud, people generally bought computers of varying sizes and power ratings to deliver the IT value they sought. With Cloud services, the same compute capacity can be rented or leased by the minute or hour, and accessed over the Internet.

There is much to learn about Cloud computing. In this introduction, we will discuss the following aspects:

* Virtualization
* Managed hosting
* What differentiates Cloud
* The various kinds of Cloud services

===== Virtualizaton

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization[Virtualization], for the purposes of this section, starts with the idea of a computer within a computer.footnote:[it has applicability to storage and networking as well but we will skip that for now] In order to understand this, we need to understand a little bit about operating systems and how they relate to the physical computer.

Assume a simple, physical computer such as a laptop:

When the laptop is first turned on, the operating system (OS) loads; the OS is itself software, but is able to directly control the computer's physical resources: its CPU, memory, screen, and any interfaces such as WiFi, USB, and Bluetooth.

 [laptop with apps]

The operating system (in a traditional approach) then is used to run "applications" such as Web browsers, media players, word processors, spreadsheets, and the like. Many such programs can also be run as applications within the browser, but the browser still needs to be run as an application.

_Figure XX. Virtualization is computers within a computer._

In the simplest form of virtualization, a specialized application known as a hypervisor is loaded like any other application. The purpose of this hypervisor is to emulate the hardware computer in software. Once the hypervisor is running, it can emulate any number of "virtual" computers, each of which can have its own operating system. The hypervisor mediates the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine["virtual machine"] (VM) access to the actual, physical hardware of the laptop; the VM can take input from the USB port, and output to the Bluetooth interface, just like the master OS that launched when the laptop was turned on.

TIP: You can experiment with a hypervisor by downloading https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtualbox] (on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and using https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] to download and initialize a Linux virtual machine. +

 You'll probably want at least 4 gb of RAM on your laptop and a gigabyte of free disk space, at the bare minimum.

There are two different kinds of hypervisors. The example we just discussed was an example of a Type 2 hypervisor, which runs on top of a host operating system. In a type 1 hypervisor, a master host OS is not used; the hypervisor runs on the "bare metal" of the computer and in turn "hosts" multiple VMs.

===== Why is virtualization important?

The idea of running IT as a utility service goes back at least to 1965 and the publication of _The Challenge of the Computer Utliity_, by Douglas Parkhill.

While the conceptual idea of Cloud and utility computing was foreseeable fifty years ago, it took many years of hard-won IT evolution to support the vision. Reliable hardware of exponentially increasing performance, robust open-source software, Internet backbones of massive speed and capacity, and many other factors converged towards this end.

It has its uses even on a laptop (as you will see if you follow certain paths in the labs.) However, it is in larger industrial uses where it has the greatest utility.

* There is a host system that can instantiate one or more guests.
 - The host system knows about the guests, but the guests do not know about the host (except as a peer system on the network, perhaps).
 - The physical resources allocated can vary according to demand



****
NOTE: Virtualization was predicted in the earliest theories that led to the development of computers. Turing and Church realized that any general purpose computer could emulate any other. Virtual systems have existed in some form since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_virtualization_development[at latest 1967] - only 20 years after the first fully functional computers. +
 +
And yes, you can run computers within computers within computers with virtualization. They get slower and slower the more levels you go in, but the logic still works.

* Multi-tenancy
 - Multi-tenancy is where multiple customers share physical resources that provide the illusion of being dedicated
 - The phone system has been multi-tenant ever since they got rid of party lines.


Virtualization vs containers

Virtualization benefits

image::images/1.02-virt-benefits.png[]

Why virtualize?

* Great for heterogeneous workloads – lots of miscellaneous applications & services running on underutilized servers
* What about where the application is large and virtualization is mostly overhead?
 - Still may make sense
* Management consistency
* Ease of restoration
* Database professionals still don’t like it
 - “The database IS virtualization” they will say

Virtualizaiton vs cloud

* “Cloud is not just virtualization” many critics will say
* Financial model
* Tenancy model
* Provisioning model
* Services beyond raw compute, storage and network
* Self-service, API-driven

Traditional managed hosting vs cloud
* Managed services: “your mess for less”
* Cloud: “clean it up first”
