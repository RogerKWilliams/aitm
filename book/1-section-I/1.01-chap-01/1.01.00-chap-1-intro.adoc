=== Chapter 1. IT Value

==== Introduction to Chapter 1

You are interested in starting a new company, perhaps based on some kind of software product. Or perhaps you find yourself working as a team member in a large enterprise, just starting out and trying to make sense of all the complexity and information coming at you every day.

Before you can talk about building and managing information technology (IT), we need to understand what it is and why people want it. We'll start this chapter by looking at an IT value experience that may seem very familiar. Then we'll dig further into concepts like the "IT stack" and the "IT service" and how they change over time.
