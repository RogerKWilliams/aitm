==== Conclusion
Applications are why computers exist. Supporting applications increasingly is less about systems engineering, and more about quickly provisioning standard, shared infrastructure. Application development has moved decisively in the past twenty years to Agile delivery models, based on techniques such as:

* story mapping
* test-driven development
* refactoring
* continuous integration
* continuous deployment

Application delivery, software development, and the Agile movement are broad, complex, and evolving topics. For those of you familiar with Agile, we have only scratched the surface in this chapter.

In future chapters we will go into more detail on topics such as:

* Product management, including behavior-driven development and continuous design (much more on requirements, user stories, etc)
* The importance of feedback
* Prioritization and cost of delay
* Scrum and Kanban
* Tracking tasks and effort
* Closing the loop from operations to development, and coping with interrupt-driven work

and much more.

===== Discussion questions
* What is your exposure to application programming?
* Can you think of examples of waterfall and agile approaches in your daily life (not necessarily related to IT?)
