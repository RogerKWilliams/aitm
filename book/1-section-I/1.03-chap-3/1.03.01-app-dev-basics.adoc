==== Basics of applications and their development

===== Defining "Application"

In keeping with our commitment to theory and first princiles, we use an engineering definition of "application." To an electrical engineer, a toaster or a light bulb is an "application" of electricity. Similarly, a customer relationship management system, or a Web video on demand service, are "applications" of the core computer infrastructure we studied in the last chapter.

===== History of applications

Without applications, computers would be merely a curiousity. Computers evolved in response to military needs for codebreaking and artillery calculations. After World War II, ex-military officers like Edmund Berkeley at Prudential realized their potential if "applied" to problems like insurance record keeping.
