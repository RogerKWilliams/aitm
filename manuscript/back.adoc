A revolutionary new textbook for students of information technology.

Prepares students for ACTUAL INDUSTRIAL IT EXPERIENCE, without being tightly coupled to particular technologies

Unique progressive approach, from startup to enterprise. In readings, lecture and labs, students take on the persona appropriate to that scale and understand how technology practices evolve as organizations scale.

Spans the entire IT experience from startup to mature enterprise.

Coverage of the Agile movement from a systems perspective. Coverage of the theories underlying Agile, as the reason for Agile success.

Practical lab experience with lightweight virtualization, source control, containerization, and infrastructure as code

Introduction of work management (product management, ticketing and Kanban fundamentals)

IT process and project simulations

Complex incident & portfolio simulations

Careful, skeptical and objective examination of process frameworks and industry “best practices,” especially as they are being challenged by emerging Agile theories

Systems theory not as an abstract end in itself, but rather woven throughout the book as intellectual scaffolding

Written and edited as a fully open source project, using collaborative Agile techniques.
